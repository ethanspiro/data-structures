This is a collection of common data structures implemented in C. Implementations include: binary search tree, dynamic array (stack, bag, RPN calculator, heap, To-Do list using heap), graph (with BFS and DFS implemented using circularly linked deque), hash-map (with implementation of a concordance), and linked list (deque, bag, and circularly linked).
